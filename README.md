# Legend-of-Zelda-Project


This is my project, where I was trying to recreate the classic game, Legend of Zelda from the NES.
As a guy who loves playing classic arcade and NES games, this was a fun project. I was able to recreate mich of the basics of the game, including the map, the game hud, one of the enemies, and the caves within the original game.
